# System Log: Project Wonderland

This is the central processing log for the `Wonderland-Kernel`. Normal text is rendered in `IBM Plex Mono` for maximum clarity and a retro feel. This system bridges the logical and the nonsensical. Here are some important links: [[Mad Hatter's Tea Party Schedule]], an external link to the [official documentation](https://obsidian.md), and a link to a file that doesn't exist yet, [[The Jabberwocky Protocol]].

This entire operation is classified under #ProjectCheshire and #TopSecret.

## Sub-Routine: Diagnostics Check

The system is running a self-diagnostic. Please review the following kernel modules and task lists.

**Module Status:**
>> Logic Engine: nominal
>> Chronometer: paradoxical
>> Reality Matrix: unstable
>> Cheshire C.A.T. Core: grinning

**Boot Sequence:**
1. Initialize Void Pointers
2. Query the Oracle
3. Paint the Roses
4. Begin Tea Ceremony

### Task List for ALICE

- [x] Follow the White Rabbit
- [ ] Drink the Potion
- [ ] Don't lose your head
- [x] Question everything

### Oracle Query Results

The system has received the following directives from the Queen of Hearts. This is a standard blockquote.

> The Queen's Edict: 'Begin at the beginning, and go on till you come to the end: then stop.'

Here are some specific system alerts, rendered using the new callout styling.

> [!NOTE] System Notification
> The March Hare reports that it's always six o'clock. Time dilation effects are within expected parameters.

> [!INFO] Glitch Detected
> The Cheshire Cat has been observed phasing between `layer-7` and `layer-8`. This is not a bug; it is a feature.

> [!SUCCESS] Execution Complete
> The vorpal blade went "snicker-snack!" The Jabberwocky has been successfully debugged from the system.

> [!WARNING] Unstable Reality
> "Curiouser and curiouser!" You appear to be growing or shrinking at an exponential rate. Please consult a caterpillar immediately.

> [!DANGER] SECURITY ALERT: OFF WITH THEIR HEADS!
> An unauthorized user (`card-02-of-spades`) attempted to access the Queen's private croquet files. The user has been scheduled for summary de-resolution.

> [!QUOTE] Caterpillar's Logic
> Who are YOU?

#### The Caterpillar's Logic Module

The following code snippet is responsible for parsing user identity. Notice the `inline code` styling.

```javascript
/*
 * The Caterpillar's Identity Function
 * Do not modify without consulting a mushroom.
 */
function whoAreYou(entity) {
  const
    MEMORY_ADDRESS = 0xDEADBEEF,
    MADNESS_LEVEL = 10;
  let identity = entity.query("self");

  if (!identity || entity.state === "confused") {
    // This is a comment, rendered in muted green.
    console.log(">> Who... are... YOU?");
    return null;
  }
  
  return `Entity ${identity.name} at ${MEMORY_ADDRESS} is ${MADNESS_LEVEL}% mad.`;
}

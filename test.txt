*The Arabian Nights*, also known as *One Thousand and One Nights*, is a famous collection of Middle Eastern and South Asian folktales passed down through centuries of oral tradition. Framed by the story of Scheherazade, a clever young woman who tells tales each night to postpone her execution by a vengeful king, the collection weaves together adventure, romance, and moral lessons. Its stories—such as those of Aladdin, Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, and Sinbad the Sailor—blend magic, mystery, and human cunning, reflecting the rich cultural exchanges of the Islamic Golden Age. Beyond their entertainment value, the tales explore themes of fate, justice, love, and wisdom, and they have profoundly influenced world literature and storytelling traditions.

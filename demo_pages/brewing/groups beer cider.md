## 1. Small Organic Molecules: Functional Group Cheat Sheet

| **Functional Group** | **Example Compound**     | **Typical Aroma/Flavor**         | **Source in Beverages**                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alcohols             | Ethanol, fusel alcohols  | Warmth, slight solvent notes     | Yeast fermentation; longer chains in higher-temp ferments |
| Esters               | Isoamyl acetate          | Fruity (banana, pear, bubblegum) | Yeast metabolism, higher fermentation temps               |
| Phenols              | 4-Vinyl guaiacol         | Spicy, clove, smoky              | Yeast (esp. Belgian/Hefe strains), barrel aging, malt     |
| Carboxylic Acids     | Acetic acid, lactic acid | Tart, sour, vinegar-like         | Acetobacter contamination, sour beer fermentation         |
| Aldehydes            | Acetaldehyde             | Green apple, grassy              | Incomplete fermentation or oxidation                      |
| Ketones              | Diacetyl                 | Buttery, slick mouthfeel         | Yeast metabolism (if not reabsorbed), bacterial infection |

**Key Tips:**

- Higher fermentation temperatures typically yield more esters (fruity profile).
    
- Aldehydes can signal a beer that wasn’t conditioned long enough or has been exposed to oxygen.
    
- Phenolic flavors can be desirable in certain beer styles (e.g., German wheat beers) but considered off-flavors in others.

## 2. Brewing & Cider-Making Process Overview

|**Process Step**|**Purpose**|**Key Points**|
|---|---|---|
|Milling/Crushing|Break grain husks, expose starches|Over-milling can cause stuck sparges; husk integrity is important.|
|Mashing|Convert starches to fermentable sugars|α & β-amylase temps → body vs fermentability; pH ~5.2 optimal.|
|Lautering/Sparging|Separate sweet wort from grain|Grain bed acts as natural filter; watch for channeling.|
|Boiling|Sterilization, hop isomerization, DMS removal|Typically 60–90 min; add hops at intervals for bitterness/aroma.|
|Cooling|Bring wort to yeast-pitch temp (~65–75 °F)|Rapid cooling reduces infection risk and yields better clarity.|
|Fermentation|Yeast converts sugars to alcohol + CO₂|Temperature control crucial; different strains = different flavors.|
|Conditioning/Aging|Allow flavors to meld, yeast to settle|Can be done cold (lagering) or warm (ale); clarifies final product.|
|Packaging|Keg, bottle, or can|Can lead to natural carbonation (bottling) or forced carbonation.|

**Cider** is similar but starts with pressed apple juice instead of wort. Fermentation management (yeast selection, pH, nutrient additions) is key since apples can have variable sugar/acid profiles.

## 3. Ingredient Roles in Beer/Cider

|**Ingredient**|**Primary Contribution**|**Example Flavor Impact**|
|---|---|---|
|Base Malt (e.g., 2-Row)|Main source of fermentable sugars, foundation of color/flavor|Bready, sweet cereal notes, light body if well-converted|
|Specialty Malt (e.g., Crystal, Chocolate)|Adds color, caramel/roast flavors, body|Caramel sweetness, toffee, chocolate, roasted coffee|
|Hops (e.g., Mosaic, Saaz)|Bitterness (early additions) & aroma/flavor (late or dry additions)|Citrusy, piney, floral, earthy, tropical fruit nuances|
|Yeast (Ale vs. Lager strains)|Ferments sugars into alcohol + CO₂; can produce esters, phenols|Ale yeast → fruity/spicy notes; Lager yeast → cleaner, crisper|
|Water (ion profile)|Affects mash pH, perceived bitterness, mouthfeel|Harder water can accentuate hops; softer water can highlight malt|
|Apples (for cider)|Base flavor, sugar, acidity, tannins|Varietal differences: sweet, tart, tannic, aromatic|

**Pro Tip:** In an exam, if asked “Which ingredient dominates the flavor?” mention **malt** (caramel, bready), **hops** (citrus, pine), **yeast** (fruity/spicy), or even **apple variety** for cider.

## 1. Amylases: α-Amylase vs. β-Amylase

|**Enzyme**|**Optimal Temp Range**|**Action on Starch**|**Effect on Wort**|**Importance**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**α-Amylase**|~150–158 °F (65–70 °C)|Breaks starches randomly into shorter chains|Produces dextrins → fuller body, sweeter finish|Higher mash temps favor α-amylase → more residual sugars|
|**β-Amylase**|~140–149 °F (60–65 °C)|Cleaves starch from the ends to release maltose (a disaccharide)|Produces more fermentable sugars → drier beer|Lower mash temps favor β-amylase → increased fermentability and dryness|

### Why It Matters

- **Flavor & Body**: Controlling mash temperature influences how sweet or dry your final beer tastes.
    
- **Fermentation Efficiency**: More fermentable sugars mean higher alcohol content and a thinner body; more dextrins leave a fuller mouthfeel.

## 2. Common Brewing Compounds (Malt, Hops, Yeast): Key Differences

|**Compound**|**Examples**|**Flavor Contributions**|**Role in Process**|**Notable Differences**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Malt**|- Base malt (2-Row, Pilsner)- Specialty (Crystal, Chocolate, Munich)|Adds bready, sweet, toffee, or roasted flavors|Source of fermentable sugars, color, body, head retention|Base malts provide majority of starch; specialty malts add color & unique flavors|
|**Hops**|- Bittering hops (Magnum, Warrior)- Aroma hops (Citra, Mosaic)- Dual-purpose (Cascade, Centennial)|Bitterness, aroma (citrus, pine, floral, tropical)|Added during boil or after (dry hop) to impart bitterness and/or aroma|Bittering hops have higher alpha acids; aroma hops bring strong flavor & aroma with lower alpha acids|
|**Yeast**|- Ale yeast (US-05, S-04)- Lager yeast (34/70, W-34/70)- Specialty (Belgian, Hefe strains)|Fruity esters (banana, pear), spicy phenols (clove), clean/neutral notes|Ferments wort into alcohol + CO₂; distinctive byproducts define beer style|Ale yeasts generally ferment warmer with more esters; lager yeasts ferment cooler and produce cleaner flavors|

### Why It Matters

- **Recipe Design**: Choosing malts for color or flavor balance, hops for bitterness/aroma, and yeast for desired fermentation byproducts is fundamental to a beer’s signature profile.
    
- **Troubleshooting**: If a beer tastes too fruity, it could be yeast or fermentation temperature issues; if it’s too bitter or unbalanced, look at hop selection/timing.

## 4. Fermentation: Step-by-Step

|**Step**|**What Happens**|**Why It’s Important**|**Key Notes**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Pitch Yeast**|Yeast is introduced to cooled, oxygenated wort|Oxygen assists yeast growth, essential for healthy fermentation|Proper pitch rate prevents off-flavors and slow starts|
|**Lag Phase**|Yeast acclimates, consumes oxygen, multiplies|Establishes yeast population necessary for efficient fermentation|Yeast health at this stage affects flavor development|
|**Exponential Growth**|Rapid yeast reproduction, sugar consumption begins|Main production of ethanol and CO₂, also flavor compounds (esters, phenols)|Temperature control critical to manage yeast byproducts|
|**High Krausen**|Peak fermentation activity, foamy head (krausen) forms|Indicates vigorous fermentation; most sugar conversion occurs here|Off-flavors can develop if fermentation is too warm|
|**Decline/Stationary**|Yeast slows down, final gravity approaches|Conditioning phase, yeast cleans up byproducts (e.g., diacetyl)|Allow enough time to avoid “green” flavors|
|**Flocculation**|Yeast clumps and settles, clearing the beer|Beer clarifies, flavor stabilizes|Some yeast strains are highly flocculent (clear faster)|

### Why It Matters

- **Flavor Control**: Fermentation stages heavily influence the final aroma and taste (esters, phenols, diacetyl).
    
- **Process Efficiency**: Understanding each phase helps brewers decide when to transfer, when to cold crash, and how long to condition.

## 5. High vs. Low Temp Wort (Mash & Fermentation)

| **Parameter**                                                                | **High Temp**                                                                                    | **Low Temp**                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mash** (e.g., 150–158 °F / 65–70 °C)                                       | - Favor α-amylase → more dextrins, fuller body - Less fermentable sugars → potentially lower ABV | - Favor β-amylase → more maltose, drier finish - More fermentable sugars → potentially higher ABV |
| **Fermentation** (Ale ~ 65–75 °F / 18–24 °C vs. Lager ~ 50–55 °F / 10–13 °C) | - Yeast produces more esters/fusel alcohols (fruity/spicy) - Faster turnaround time              | - Cleaner, crisper flavor - Slower fermentation, requires more time                               |

### Why It Matters

- **Style Definition**: Certain beer styles (e.g., Belgian ales) thrive on higher fermentation temps for those signature esters. Lagers need cooler temps for a clean profile.
    
- **Mouthfeel & ABV**: Adjusting mash temp changes how much sugar is available for yeast to convert into alcohol and how sweet or dry the final product is.

## 6. Types of Hops: Bittering vs. Aroma vs. Dual-Purpose

|**Type**|**Key Examples**|**Alpha Acid Range**|**Typical Usage**|**Flavor/Aroma Notes**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Bittering**|Magnum, Warrior, Target|High (10–16%+)|Early in boil (60+ minutes) for bitterness|Often have strong bitterness; aroma less important, can be neutral or herbal|
|**Aroma**|Saaz, Hallertau, Tettnang (noble hops) Cascade, Citra, Mosaic (modern aroma hops)|Lower to moderate (3–9%)|Late boil (10 min or less), whirlpool, or dry hop for aroma|Earthy/spicy (noble) or citrus, tropical, floral (modern)|
|**Dual-Purpose**|Centennial, Simcoe, Amarillo|Moderate to high (8–12%)|Can be used at beginning for bitterness or at end for aroma|Balances decent bitterness potential with distinctive aroma/flavor profiles|

### Why It Matters

- **Bitterness vs. Flavor**: Adding hops early extracts bitterness but boils off aroma. Late/dry hopping emphasizes aromatics but adds less bitterness.
    
- **Style Differences**: Traditional European lagers use noble hops for subtle floral/spicy notes; American IPAs use bold, aromatic hops for citrusy/piney intensity.

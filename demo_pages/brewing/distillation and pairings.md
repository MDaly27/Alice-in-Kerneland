## 4. Distillation & Spirit Overview (Vodka, Absinthe, Rum, Gin)

| **Spirit**   | **How It’s Made**                                                                                                                        | **Key Characteristics**                                                        | **Typical Flavor Profile**                                                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vodka**    | - Distilled from neutral grains/potatoes - Often multiple distillations - Generally column still                                         | Very high purity, minimal impurities                                           | Clean, neutral, slight grain sweetness; mouthfeel can be silky or crisp                             |
| **Absinthe** | - Base spirit typically from grains or other fermentables - Flavor infused with botanicals, notably wormwood, anise, fennel              | Requires maceration of botanicals before/following distillation                | Herbal, licorice/anise-forward, sometimes bitter from wormwood, can louche (turn cloudy) with water |
| **Rum**      | - Fermented from sugarcane juice or molasses - Pot or column still - Often barrel-aged                                                   | Light or dark, can be unaged (white rum) or aged (gold/dark rum)               | Sweet, molasses/caramel notes (in dark rums), tropical fruit esters in some styles                  |
| **Gin**      | - Neutral spirit redistilled with juniper berries + botanicals - Often uses a column still with a botanical basket or pot still infusion | Juniper is the defining botanical; dryness depends on style (London Dry, etc.) | Juniper-forward, citrus, floral, earthy or spicy notes from coriander, angelica root, etc.          |
|              |                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                |                                                                                                     |

**Notable Points:**

- **Heads, Hearts, Tails** concept: Distiller cuts off early distillate (heads = undesirable) and late distillate (tails = fusel oils). The “hearts” portion is what’s typically bottled.
    
- **Aging**: Many spirits (rum, whiskey) gain complexity from barrel aging (vanillin, oak tannins). Vodka and gin often go unaged or minimally aged. Absinthe typically is not aged long (sometimes rested briefly).

## 6. Pairing Examples & Logic

| **Beverage**                     | **Food Pairing**                    | **Rationale**                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hoppy IPA (Citrus/Pine)          | Spicy Tacos or Avocado Toast        | Bitterness and carbonation cut through fatty/spicy elements; avocado’s richness is balanced by the IPA’s hop bite |
| Malty Amber Ale                  | Grilled Cheese, Caramelized Onions  | Toasty sweet malts complement browned, toasty flavors in bread/onions                                             |
| Belgian Witbier                  | Seafood, Light Salads               | Citrus/spicy coriander notes match delicate fish or fresh greens                                                  |
| Dark Rum (mixed or neat)         | Grilled Pineapple, Caramel Dessert  | Rum’s sweet/caramel/molasses notes echo the fruit’s caramelization                                                |
| Gin & Tonic                      | Herb-Crusted Chicken or Light Pasta | Herbal juniper and quinine bitterness cut through mild savory dishes                                              |
| Absinthe (sipped or in cocktail) | Dark chocolate or licorice desserts | Complex herbal notes complement bitter chocolate or licorice sweets                                               |

**Tip for Exam Answers**:

- Always give a **why** in pairing: e.g., “Belgian witbier’s citrusy profile complements the lemon or citrus dressing in a salad,” or “The smoky phenols in a stout can contrast the sweetness in a chocolate dessert.”

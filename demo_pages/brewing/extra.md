- **Planned vs. Post-hoc Comparisons**
    
    - Multiple comparisons ⇒\Rightarrow⇒ inflated Type I error. Use Tukey’s HSD, Bonferroni, or similar.
        
    - NEJM guidelines discourage uncritical p-values for unplanned contrasts—prefer stating effect sizes, confidence intervals, or doing a new study.
        
- **Random Effects in ANOVA**
    
    - Models grouped or hierarchical data (e.g., blocks, repeated measures).
        
    - Partitioning variance into group-level variance vs. error variance can sharpen estimates of main (fixed) effects.

# Checklist of Topics and Concepts to Review

1. **Relative Risk vs. Odds Ratio**  
   - Differences in interpretation and assumptions
   - Situations where RR vs. OR is preferred

2. **Central Limit Theorem**  
   - Conditions for approximate normal distribution of sample means
   - Large sample sizes and implications

3. **Regression Coefficients**  
   - β’s as parameters vs. variables, and interpretation in linear models
   - Role of α (intercept) in continuous and binary predictor contexts

4. **Model Assumptions & Violations**  
   - Checking normality, independence, homoscedasticity (equal variances)
   - Transformations, random effects, alternative models

5. **Parameter Collinearity**  
   - How it affects estimates, p-values, and overfitting
   - Potential solutions: variable selection, regularization (AIC, etc.)

6. **ANOVA F Statistic**  
   - Signal (treatment/group variance) vs. noise (unexplained/error variance)
   - Relation to the concept of “explained” vs. “unexplained” variance

7. **Paired vs. Two-Sample T-Tests**  
   - Why pairing reduces background variance
   - Greater power when the same subjects are measured in both conditions

8. **Effect Size (R²) vs. Significance (p-value)**  
   - R² as proportion of variance explained
   - p-value as measure of statistical significance

9. **Post-Hoc Comparisons & Multiple Testing**  
   - Inflated Type I error (familywise error)
   - Role of NEJM guidelines, Bonferroni, Tukey’s HSD, replication

10. **Outliers**  
   - When to discard vs. when to keep
   - Alternatives: robust or non-parametric methods, transformations

11. **Random Effects**  
   - Accounting for grouping/blocking factors
   - Improving precision by reducing residual variance

12. **Overfitting**  
   - High variance, fitting the noise
   - Using AIC, cross-validation to detect/avoid

13. **Scientific vs. Statistical Significance**  
   - Theoretical or mechanistic reasons for including variables
   - Interpreting non-significant variables in context

14. **Interaction Terms**  
   - How they alter interpretation of main effects
   - Meaning of “the effect of X₁ depends on X₂” and vice versa

15. **Choosing Model Complexity**  
   - Balancing simpler vs. multi-covariate approaches
   - Checking residuals, collinearity, interpretability

16. **Residual Diagnostic Plots**  
   - Recognizing patterns of poor model fit
   - Normal Q–Q, scale-location, leverage/Cook’s D

17. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**  
   - Why overly simple models have high bias
   - Why overly complex models have high variance

18. **Publication Bias & Meta-Analyses**  
   - Funnel plots, suppressed negative or non-significant findings
   - Inflated effect sizes in published literature

19. **Regression to the Mean**  
   - How extreme values revert to more typical states over repeated measures
   - Common real-world misinterpretations (e.g., punishment vs. praise effects)

20. **Multi-Analyst Studies**  
   - Variation in results from different analytical approaches
   - Importance of replication, standardization, and confirmatory designs

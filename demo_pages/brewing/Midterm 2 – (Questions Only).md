## EXAM II (SPRING 24)

This exam is composed of 21 questions on 6 pages.  
**Note:** You should leave one question blank. If you answer all the questions, your answer for question 21 will not be graded.  
Be sure to write your name on each page of the exam, and check that you have all of the pages. Questions total 40 points.  
You have one hour and fifteen minutes to complete the exam. Think about maximizing the number of points that you earn during the exam period, and read the questions carefully.  
This exam is administered under the Notre Dame Honor Code. All answers are expected to be your own. You may use notes hand-written on ONE regular sheet of paper.  
Please:
- Write neatly.
- Don’t write beyond the space allotted.
- Show your work.

Good Luck!

### I. MULTIPLE CHOICE (2 points each)
Circle or write the letter of your choice for each question below.

1. A difference between relative-risk (RR) and the odds-ratio (OR) is:  
   A) RR measures an association between two categorical variables.  
   B) OR measures an association between two categorical variables.  
   C) RR assumes unbiased estimates of the probability of two outcomes in the population of interest.  
   D) None of the above is a difference between RR and OR.

2. The central limit theorem assures us that the mean of a random sample is approximately normally distributed,  
   A) so long as the sample distribution is approximately normal.  
   B) so long as the population distribution is approximately normal.  
   C) so long as the standard deviation of the sample is approximately normal.  
   D) so long as the sample size is large enough.

3. The coefficients in a regression model (the β’s) are:  
   A) parameters  
   B) variables  
   C) factors  
   D) statistics

4. Which of the following is an inappropriate solution to violations of model assumptions?  
   A) Transform the data.  
   B) Collect more data.  
   C) Discard data that don’t fit the model assumptions.  
   D) Use a different model.

5. Parameter collinearity can lead to  
   A) poor estimates of parameter coefficients.  
   B) artificially high or low p-values.  
   C) overfitting.  
   D) All of the above are true.

### II. SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS (2 points each)

6. We often say that statistics evaluates the signal-to-noise ratio. How is the “F value” in an ANOVA table an example of this idea?

7. All else being equal, paired t-tests are more powerful than two-sample t-tests. Describe the main difference between these tests and why it affects statistical power.

8. In ANOVA and regression, R² is a measure of the effect size. Describe in words what R² is and why it measures something different from what a p-value measures.

9. The New England Journal of Medicine changed its guidelines for statistical reporting, discouraging the reporting of p-values for post-hoc comparisons. What problem is the NEJM trying to avoid, and what could researchers do to assess whether an apparently significant post-hoc comparison is truly important?

10. What is the argument for not discarding an outlier, and what is a good option for analysis if you don’t discard that outlier?

11. What are random effects and how do they help reduce the uncertainty in estimates of fixed effects?

12. The equation Y = α + β₁X₁ + ε could be the formula for a simple linear regression (if X is a continuous variable) or a t-test (if X is a binary (0 or 1) variable). What does α estimate in each case?

13. In theory, you could keep adding additional covariates to a linear model (X₂, X₃, X₄, etc.). Why might this lead to “overfitting” and what could you do to check that overfitting isn’t a problem for a complex model?

14. Give an example of a scientific (biological, physical, etc.) reason to include a variable in a regression model. Do you think it is defensible to include such a variable even if that variable is not significant?

15. If there is a significant interaction term in a model (e.g., β₃X₁ * X₂), how does this affect the interpretation of the main effects (e.g., β₁X₁ and β₂X₂) on the response variable (Y)?

16. Which is a better statistical approach: Fitting one model with many variables or fitting separate models for each variable? Why?

17. Pick two of these residual diagnostic plots and explain why they suggest this is a bad model for the data.

18. Explain either (a) how models that are too simple lead to high bias or (b) how models that are too complex lead to high variance.

19. How does publication bias affect meta-analyses?

20. An Air Force instructor made this argument against the view that praise is more effective than punishment for learning:
   > “On many occasions I have praised flight cadets for clean execution of some aerobatic maneuver, and in general when they try it again, they do worse. On the other hand, I have often screamed at cadets for bad execution, and in general they do better the next time. So please don’t tell me that reinforcement works and punishment does not, because the opposite is the case.”
   
   Describe “regression to the mean” and explain why this is a better explanation for this pattern than either teaching strategy.

21. In Suzanne Hoogeveen’s many-analyst study of religiosity and well-being, most of the 120 teams found small positive effects of perceived cultural norms on the benefit of religiosity on well-being. However, some analysts found no evidence for this effect and a few found large positive effects. How confident are you about the impact of cultural norms on the benefits of religiosity from this study? Briefly identify a next step that would give you more confidence.

## 1. Malt Table

| **Malt Type**      | **Example**  | **Description / Notes**                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Base Malt**      | 2-Row Pale   | Commonly used in many ales; provides the main fermentable sugars and a lightly sweet, bready flavor. |
| **Base Malt**      | Pilsner      | Primarily used in lagers and lighter ales; contributes a clean, delicate malt character.             |
| **Specialty Malt** | Crystal 60 L | Adds caramel sweetness, golden to reddish color, and fuller mouthfeel.                               |

## 2. Hops Table

|**Hop Type**|**Example**|**Usage / Flavor Notes**|
|---|---|---|
|**Bittering Hop**|Magnum|High alpha acids (10–16%+); added early in the boil for clean, strong bitterness.|
|**Aroma Hop**|Citra|Notable for citrusy, tropical fruit aromas; often used late in boil or dry hopping.|
|**Dual-Purpose Hop**|Centennial|Moderate-high alpha acids; can be used for both bitterness (early) and aroma (late).|

## 3. Yeast Table

|**Yeast Category**|**Example**|**Flavor Profile / Fermentation Notes**|
|---|---|---|
|**Ale Yeast**|US-05 (American)|Produces clean, neutral ales with moderate esters; ferments ~ 65–72 °F (18–22 °C).|
|**Lager Yeast**|Saflager 34/70|Clean, crisp profile with minimal esters; ferments at cooler temps (~50–55 °F / 10–13 °C).|
|**Specialty Yeast**|Belgian Abbey Strain|Creates fruity, spicy phenols (clove, pepper) and esters (banana, pear); warmer ferment.|

## 4. Wort Table

Here, we’re distinguishing worts based on mash or gravity approach—focusing on temperature or sugar content, both critical to final beer characteristics.

|**Wort Type**|**Example / Approach**|**Key Characteristics**|
|---|---|---|
|**Low-Temperature Mash Wort**|Mash at ~148 °F (64 °C)|Higher fermentability (favoring β-amylase), drier finish, thinner body.|
|**High-Temperature Mash Wort**|Mash at ~156 °F (69 °C)|More dextrins (favoring α-amylase), sweeter finish, fuller body.|
|**High-Gravity Wort**|Very high OG (e.g., >1.070)|More sugars = higher potential ABV, richer mouthfeel, requires robust yeast.|

## Why These Distinctions Matter

1. **Malt**: Determines the backbone of your beer’s flavor, color, and fermentable sugar content. Base malts provide most of the fermentables, while specialty malts fine-tune color and add unique flavor dimensions (caramel, roast, etc.).
    
2. **Hops**: The timing and type of hops used define a beer’s bitterness level (IBUs) and flavor/aroma profile. Bittering hops are about alpha acid utilization, while aroma hops add character near the end of the boil or in dry hopping.
    
3. **Yeast**: This is the engine of fermentation. Different strains have unique flavor outputs (esters, phenols) and temperature ranges, which significantly impact the sensory profile of the final beer.
    
4. **Wort**: By varying mash temperature and wort gravity, you control how fermentable or rich your final product will be. This directly affects body, alcohol level, and the dryness/sweetness balance.
